title: Did I waste my time 'launching' on product hunt?
description: Reflecting on a failed Product Hunt launch. Why did I do this in the first place?
---

I should admit, I had my project featured on Product Hunt before -- for no particular reason. It was a total hack - just a bunch of links with some text and a [fancy domain](http://www.howtodigitalnomad.com/) (with 'digital nomads' trigger word). it was intoxicating! If only I built something **serious** ... right?

Two years later... I spent 2 days preparing to launch [FbaCatalog](https://fbacatalog.com) on Product Hunt. I did all of it:
- different messages for different 'mediums' -- twitter, facebook, reddit, indie hackers -- you name it
- good enough subscriber list from fbamonthly.com
- screenshots, description
- "recommended" timing for a post on PH

I probably overdid it in my attempt to "make it". [I didn't get featured...](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/fba-catalog) But something else was buzzing in my mind all this time... "Why did I launch on PH?"

There were enough reasons not to... I did my research:
- There was very view Amazon Seller related projects on PH
- I already tried launching https://fbamonthly.com with zero luck

All this time tt was in my face -- my target audience was not on PH. I'm probably trying to admit, that I spent two whole days stroking my ego in a right way.
