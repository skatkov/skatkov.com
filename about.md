# HEY, VISITOR!
  
  My name is Stanislav Katkov. But you can call me - 
  Stas. I hope you'll leave comment in my guestbook...
  just joking.

## CARRIER

  I like to tinker with things -- mostly it's software.
  
  There is a curvy footpath of my involved in different
  aspects of creating software professionally. Traces of
  my activities can be found here:

## NO-OFFICE

  In search for productivity improvements I abandoned 
  grey walls and cubicles to find them completely unnaceptable
  for productive work.

  I managed to fight introversion and speak at Devclub about
  digital nomad journey and transition from freelancer 
  to remote CTO that I had. Unfortunately, everything
  is in Russian.

## SKYLUP

  I manage multiple bootstrapped side-projects. And I'm
  blessed with friends that help me with it.
