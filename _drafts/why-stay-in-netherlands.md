title: Why stay in Netherlands?
---

It's been more than a year since I'm living in Netherlands. In retrospect, trying to understand if moving here was a great idea on my side. These thoughts creep in on me especially often with current background - higher bills, war on european border and etc.

Living in Asia seemed easier - taxes are lower, cost of life is lower, weather is warm, people seem more chill, going out is more affordable, all the issues felt really far away. Our appartment in Netherlands costs like a 5 bedroom house in Thailand with a huge garden. And one time we got fined for 230 EURO for leaving a garbage next to a garbage, because garbage itself was full!

And don't get me started on cellphone operators in Netherlands - it feels like a daylight robery in comparison with same services in Thailand for 1/4 of price.

## So was it... a good idea?
To be absolutely frank, if I would be single and without kid on my hands -- I'd be long gone, sitting on some island - writting some sort of project again and wakeboarding. But I'm not single, so have to view this decision from a collective standpoint.

## Normality
We're blending in Netherlands. Having Asian-looking wife is nothing special here. Being a westerner-looking is not a big deal in Europe. Mixed kids are everywhere here. 

There are bunch of families with similar cultural differences like us. We're normal here.

### Friends
If your living in Asia, you're very likely to hang out with foreigners. This was less so for me in Vietnam or Taiwan. But foreigners come from all sort of walks in life.

Having compatible friends here seems easier - easier to find "my tribe" of geeks.

### Medical care
I periodcally talk with GP about my own health and about kids health. Never did he prescribe us any pills, no antibiotics. Once he prescribed icecream for a kid -- kid loves him now! But previously my son was afraid of all doctors.

Doctors here can speak English. They answer messages online. Most of the drugs are paid for and will be ready in closest farmacy on a next day.


### Work
Netherlands is small, but with densly populared society - competition for good jobs is fierce! People are really good here at jobs, and jobs are usually pretty good at onboarding people.

### Kid
Kid loves it here. He wake up by himself to school - ready to go. I don't remember myself being so entusiastic about school in a loong while.



## No car
Not having a car and being able to use bicycle or micromobolity transportation is such a blessing. Anyone can use that - my son, my wife. I don't need to drive people to places.
