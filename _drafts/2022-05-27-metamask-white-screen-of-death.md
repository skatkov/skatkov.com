If your new to crypto/web3 -- I should say, that it's damn nervous experience. Rug pulls, scams, contract risks makes it a wild west of financial market.
My causin managed to double invested money within a month on DeFi, but immediately lost all of those earnings with a clean sweap of his metamask wallet.

I'm generally very risk averse and paranoid with a lot of things. And that helped me dodge a lot of those scam and rugs, but even I turned pale once after my metamask screen showed me white screen.
