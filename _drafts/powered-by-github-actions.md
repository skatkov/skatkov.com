Big tech has been failing us over and over. They get us addicted to their services, charging us basically no money at all at first, but later, once VC funding dries up, they rake our content hostage, start charging ebsuberant fees, change their focus to B2B or even worse - close down.

It happens with everything - blog services, photo storage, data synching. All these services popped up with offers that are too good to belive, I got seriosly addicted. But at some point, they just became unberable to use already or just close down.

I've been hopping from one startup to another, lossing my digital trace along the way. And my cynism has grown bigger and bigger - if you're not at least v3 or not 5 years in a business  - I don't want to rely on your services. I've taken everything into my own hand - I selfhost everything dear to my and my families heart.


Selfhosting is not without it's own downsides either - running your own servers, ensure that backup is functional and software gets regularly updated. But I do software engineering for living, I can manage, but seriously don't really want to do so.

In this little blog post I wanted to share my biggest findings from self-hosting. How to self-hosted, but avoid running your own servers (and not having all the headache).
