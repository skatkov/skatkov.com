Github is by far my most loved and visited website on the internet. This website became a main reason I started more actively contribute to open source, I've learned so much over years while browsing random repositiries there.  

With microsoft at a wheel, I do wonder about it's future. With time, there are more and more frustrations I have while using my favorite site on internet. I come to the point, thinking that there could come a day, where I will lose access to repositories that I care a lot about. So why not back them up?
