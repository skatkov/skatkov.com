Really wanted to build a project from scratch and so I did. Project turned into a command line utility for daily journaling. I used golang for that, entire project seems to highly motivated by me trying to practice golang. 

At some point, after writting in various programing languages you start to wonder... Will another language make that big of a difference to justify time spent on mastering it? 

In case of golang learning curve was really low. It might be language, it might be my approach or might be combination of two. So I wrote down some of my learnings.

# Open source
One of the big reasons I got interested in golang, was huge amount of awesome go projects in open source. I personally use roughly around ~10 open source projects on a computer I'm sitting at now.

I couldn't stop reading source code - it was easy to digest, even without prior experience in language! So I said "this seems easy, I should try writting my app with go".

# Github Copilot
Copilot is amazingly good. In some cases it fills in 80% of a method I'm planning to write and almost also guesses assertions in tests that I plan to do.

With Copilot I didn't need to disrupt my coding flow. I wrote a descriptive method name and AI filled in the "blanks". I've tweaked the hell out of it, especially with auto-complete - it's easy.

It's creepy, how fast Copilot allowed me to pick up a language.

# Charm TUI
https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea 
BubbleTea TUI framework is amazingly great looking. It also follows ELM architecture and this architecture works great with golang. I was blown away to find a framework of such a quality and with so much simplisity!

# Documentation
I refused to google/stackoverflow things and just browsed official docs often. I always stumble upon something interesting there!
