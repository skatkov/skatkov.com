title: Installing Custom Addons on Firefox Android
---
I've been waiting until any browser on mobile will start supporting addons/extensions. And finally Firefox is doing that! 

Unfortunately, this ability is still hidden under developer settings and only available in Nightly build. It's been a while since they started supporting that and it's still is not widely available.

I had to refresh this knowledge more than once, so it's time to write it down.


## Installing Firefox Nightly
You need a "Firefox Nightly for Developers" build to have access to this feature.

Don't worry, this browser is pretty stable and very similar to main firefox browser on android. It just offers upcoming features earlier for advanced users.

## Enable Debug mode
1. Open Firefox Nightly and go to "Settings".
2. Tap on "About Firefox Nightly"
3. Tap on Firefox logo five times, until you'll receive “Debug menu enabled” popup.
4. Go back to "Settings" and click on "Custom Add-ons collection"
