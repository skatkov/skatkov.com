title: I sold it, now I have to build it - Posh TUI
---

After I shut down my last "startup" aShop, I've been hanging in a limbo thinking of what to dedicate my life to next. All this time I've been busy working on smaller projects like [briefcake](https://briefcake.com), [stoic](https://github.com/skatkov/stoic), [NicheSheets](https://nichesheets.com) or contributing to open source just not to lose that "building muscle".

But today, that will change. I found my calling!

## My calling
It's a TUI(Text-based User Interface) app that I call "Posh". Posh is an API Documentation Browser for developers, if you don't know what the hell that means, please [follow a link to read my sales pitch](https://skatkov.gumroad.com/l/pxbxx).

I'm a big fan of [Dash app](https://kapeli.com/dash) on OSX - it is as good as it gets. But these days I'm a Linux nerd and only get to enjoy Dash on work laptop (We're required to use OSX). While working on my own laptop, I only get to wonder "why there is nothing like this for Linux?".

I know, there are numerous open source alternatives out there, but they don't come close to level of polish and usefulness to Dash app. This has been my ongoing frustration since first day of using Linux, within these 3 years I tried everything to deal with it. 

Couple of months ago, my despair reached such levels, that decision to build a prototype of app appeared. I took documentation from [DevDocs](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/devdocs) and tried to build CLI around it.

I managed to get a nice documentation browser in a CLI, with ability to read docs like a book. But for more advanced features, like search, using DevDocs documentation didn't cut it at all. 

It struck me, how big of a challenge this is. It's not a side-project, this requires full time commitment. 

And I chicken out...

## How I sold it, without building
But now, when understanding how to build it was there... I couldn't get it out of my mind. Kept building smaller projects, but couldn't get any satisfaction out of them and kept going back to Posh TUI.

It was an obsession:
- Kept talking with friends about it
- Kept researching what is possible to build with it
- Kept refining technical requirements
- Kept researching what competition is doing
- Started contributing to similar open source projects

How can I ensure, that this is a viable business idea, without sinking so much time to build working version?
