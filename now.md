# Settling down
We call Netherlands our home and looking for a house to buy! 
 
# Building a book collection
I like having books around and now since I'm settled, I got a bookshelf and stacking books. Happy to receive a recommendation or book gift!

# Spare time
I experimented with smaller projects and open source, not to lose a builder mindset. But I'll be focusing all my time into Posh TUI - API Documentation Browser in console.

# Habits are everything!
Working on building up correct set of habits. Family life requires some stability and balance is easy to tip over.
