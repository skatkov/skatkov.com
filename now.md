# Settling down
We call Eindhoven city in Netherlands our home now. We got our home and I'm slowly becoming a part time handy man to get this house up to our standards.
 
# Sports
At my age, I can't take shortcuts in terms of physical activity - so I'm trying to regularly train Kickboxing/Muay Thai and go wakeboarding at least one a week.

# Spare time
At my free time I work on my passion project - https://poshtui.com. I don't write about it much, to focus more on building. But I try to sell some lifetime license for early stage adopters. App is a bit lacking now, but it's getting there step by step.

# Habits are everything!
Working on building up correct set of habits. Family life requires some stability and balance is easy to tip over.
