## Side-projects
Launching side-projects greatly contributes to my self-learning. Here's the list of projects I launched recently and still maintain:
- [aShop.co](https://www.ashop.co) - Effortless Store platform for Amazon Sellers 
- [aCart.to](https://www.acart.to) - One of a kind Amazon product shortener

Projects that are still available, but I don't maintain those anymore:
- [HowToDigitalNomad.com](http://www.howtodigitalnomad.com/) - Collection of usefull resources for Digital Nomads
- [FbaMonthly.com](https://www.fbamonthly.com) - Independent twice-a-month free news for busy Sellers and Amazon Geeks 
- [FbaCatalog.com](https://www.fbacatalog.com) - Biggest software catalog for Amazon Sellers

There is also a graveyard of other projects that are not available anymore.
