## Side-projects
Launching side-projects greatly contributes to my self-learning. Here's the list of projects I launched recently and still maintain:
- [aShop.co](https://www.ashop.co) - Effortless Store platform for Amazon Sellers 
- [aCart.to](https://www.acart.to) - One of a kind Amazon product shortener
- [FbaMonthly.com](https://www.fbamonthly.com) - Independent twice-a-month free newsletter for busy Sellers and Amazon Geeks 
- [FbaCatalog.com](https://www.fbacatalog.com) - Biggest software catalog for Amazon Sellers

## Open-source

In my free time, I maintain very lean gems for my personal use:
- [carriage](https://rubygems.org/gems/carriage) - Carriage is a Ruby wrapper to Amazon's Cart Form functionality
- [acts-as-taggable-array-on](https://rubygems.org/gems/acts-as-taggable-array-on) - Simple tagging gem for Rails using postgres array.
- [vaccum](https://rubygems.org/gems/vacuum) - A wrapper to the Amazon Product Advertising API
- [peanut_labs](https://rubygems.org/gems/peanut_labs) - Simply library for integration with peanutlabs.com webiste
