## On Hold
Most of these are on hold, because I consider these "feature complete". But I still continue using these.

- [NicheSheets.com](https://nichesheets.com) - I've been actively using google spreadsheets in the past and built some tooling for it. This is me trying to sell it.
- [miniflux-email-client](https://github.com/skatkov/miniflux-email-client) - <mark data-tooltip="Open-source">OSS</mark> My email client for [Miniflux RSS reader](https://miniflux.app/). I always forget to open RSS reader and read it, but daily emails are easier to manage.
- [Stoic](https://github.com/skatkov/stoic) - <mark data-tooltip="Open-source">OSS</mark> command line app for daily journaling with plain-text files. Integrates with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).
